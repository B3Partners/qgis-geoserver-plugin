GeoServer Explorer QGIS Plugin
*******************************

A plugin to configure and manage GeoServer from QGIS.

Installation
=============

To install, run the following in a terminal (you will need to have `paver <http://paver.github.io/paver/>`_ installed):

::

	$ paver setup
	$ paver install

The first command will fetch the dependencies required by the plugin. The second one will install the plugin in your local QGIS plugins folder. Open QGIS and you should already see the GeoServer Explorer plugin available in your QGIS plugin manager.
